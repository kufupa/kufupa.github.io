<h4><u> 
Poster:
</h4></u> 
<p>
We designed a fun poster that we placed in areas around the school such as in the Canteens, locker areas and foyers. The aim of the poster was to educate others in the school about CanSat and what our primary and secondary missions were and provide a short sentence about its significance. This was important because an overwhelming and busy poster would not convey the information as clearly.

<h4><u> 
Presentation to Yr. 10s:
</h4></u> 
<p>
The school gave us permission to give a 10 minute presentation to year 10s at our school. In this talk, we showed some of the data collected whilst offering a brief explanation. We also talked about the whole design process and some of the struggles we faced and why we chose the secondary mission of determining if a volcano was active.

<h4><u> 
Presentation to 6th Form:
</h4></u> 
<p>
We presented our final presentation at the Senior Computer Science club which is attended predominantly by the 6th Form, but also available to students from the younger years. We succinctly covered our secondary mission but to tailor the wants of our audience talked through the type of components and code used and why; as well as the main problems we had in the programming and how these were overcome.

<h4><u> 
Website:
</h4></u> 
<p>
We designed, built and published our own website, a task which was very new to us but enabled us to learn new coding languages and skills which differed to the programming of the electronic components of the CanSat. We tried to make the website as engaging as possible and covered topics including the design, constructing and testing process of our CanSat and more information about our missions and goals. This website was then publicised on our school’s newsletter and on our schools internal weekly news.

<h4><u> 
School newsletter article:
</h4></u> 
<p>
We wrote an article for our school external newsletter for parents and students. This article covered the details of our launch and the goal was to convey more information about the competition, what we learned from it and, importantly, what our secondary mission was and its context for future missions to Mars and Mars-like planets.

<h4><u> 
Google assistant questions:
</h4></u> 
<p>
We programmed new functions into the Google Assistant which allows it to answer questions about our project. This is available to anyone with an android phone, chrome or a Google Home supported device. This allows the outreach experience to be even more interactive! We chose Google Assistant compared to Alexa because, despite Alexa being slightly more popular at present, none of us had an Alexa device to test it on.
